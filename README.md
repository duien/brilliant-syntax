# :sparkles: Brilliant :sparkles:

A bright, colorful syntax theme that coordinates well with the Material color palette. Primarily purple, with plenty of pink, orange, and green. The successor to my previous syntax theme, [Princess](https://github.com/duien/princess-syntax)

    apm install brilliant-syntax
